* R&D Data Science Community - leader of a highly-engaged community of data scientists, analysts and engineers globally across Pharma R&D with over 300 active members. Delivered multiple global symposia, educational forums and events for data scientists to connect, network, share best practices, problems, and resources.  

Technical Leadership   
* AI/ML Biopharm Development Optimization – Developed, tested and deployed a productionized, robust and reusable automated image analysis framework to accelerate biopharm cell line development processes through the use of neural networks and interactive visualizations. Benefits included:  
  *	Reduced cycle times for cell line stability assessment by 80%.
  *	Reduced potential human bias during analysis leading to improved quality of decision-making.
  *	Improved performance rate and consistency, allowing multiple projects to be pursued in parallel.

* Accelerating Genetic Evaluation of Prospective and Existing Drug Targets - Delivered a scalable and robust pipeline using Apache Spark to enable R&D scientists at GSK to look for links between DNA and health outcomes on a massive scale. Benefits include:  
  *	Reduced time for data preparation and association testing by 90%. 
  *	Enabled scientists to identify & validate drug targets earlier in the drug discovery process.  
  * Led to $300 M investment decision and 4-year collaboration with 23andMe.
